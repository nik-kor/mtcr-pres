# Monorepo concourse resource

export { default as theme } from 'mdx-deck/themes'

# Intro

* `scm-front-apps` is a 20+ projects monorepo
* we use Concourse for CI since the beginning
* Concourse work perfectly with one-project repos

---

## Background

* we were experimenting a lot with "standard" means
* we had a few iterations of pipelines
* there are no good resources for monorepos
